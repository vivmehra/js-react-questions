    <h1>Why we write DOCTYPE in HTML ? Its usage</h1>
    <li>The DOCTYPE declaration is an instruction to the web browser about what version of HTML the page is written in</li>
    <li>This ensures that the web page is parsed the same way by different web browsers</li>
    <li>It prevents the browser from switching to quirks mode ( The non-standard behavior of the layout in Navigator 4 and Internet Explorer 5)</li>
