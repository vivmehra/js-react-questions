    <h1>SOLID Principles</h1>

    <ul>
      <li>
        S - Single-responsiblity Principle.
        <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A class should have one and only one reason to change, meaning that a class should have only one job to do.</div>
      </li>
      <li>
        O - Open-closed Principle.
        <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Objects or entities should be open for extension but closed for modification.</div>
        <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This means that a class should be extendable without modifying the class itself.</div>
      </li>
      <li>
        L - Liskov Substitution Principle.
        <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Every subclass or derived class should be substitutable for their base or parent class.</div>
      </li>
      <li>
        I - Interface Segregation Principle.
        <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A client should never be forced to implement an interface that it doesn’t use, or clients shouldn’t be forced to depend on methods they do not use.</div>
      </li>
      <li>
        D - Dependency Inversion Principle.
        <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Entities must depend on abstractions, not on concretions. It states that the high-level module must not depend on the low-level module, but they should depend on abstractions.</div>
      </li>
    </ul>
